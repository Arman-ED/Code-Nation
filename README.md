Student Name: Arman Nehzomi
For each question which includes ‘describe’ or ‘review’, write at least a paragraph worth of content to explain your answers. Include any other relevant evidence where appropriate, i.e. links or images.

Q1. Describe the purpose of using IT in creating your website and how you will use IT to plan and carry out the necessary tasks. (How will you plan your website, what audience is it aimed at? How will your use of IT achieve the required outcomes in your plan?)

-I will use a combination of tools to plan the website. Trello will be used to track tasks whilst I’ll also draft sample layouts using Photoshop.

Q2. Describe methods, skills and resources needed to complete your website - explain what IT systems and software applications you need to be successful in your website project, and how you will use them (Describe at least one method, skill and resource needed to complete your website)

-IT usage in this project involves use of correct tools along with understanding of the code needed to structure the site. Software used includes Visual Studio Code and online tools such as Trello to plan and program the website. In addition, I made use of further resources such as w3 schools and Faradars to help overcome particular challenges.

Q3. Describe the legal guidelines and risks that might impact your website project - how does GDPR and copyright affect website development?

-The website uses a background image sourced from another creative. In this case, the graphic designer has given a free commercial license for anyone to use, so no further work on my part is required in order to use it. As a matter of courtesy, I have credited the photographer within the opening html tags.
As for GDPR, I need to ensure that I am not releasing personal information (including images, names etc) regarding anyone involved without their consent.

Q4. Review the ongoing use of IT tools you have used for your website and describe whether they are appropriate - what are the benefits and drawbacks of IT tools and systems used? (Are you happy with the tools you used?)

-Visual Studio Code is a great platform to program websites on - when you make use of the live server plugins - you get instant feedback without having to reload your website.
CSS is generally a useful method of making your website look attractive however it is sometimes unforgiving and unintuitive when building layouts.

Q5. Describe how you would test your website to make sure it looks as intended. Describe what kind of files you used in your website and explain why you have chosen those filetypes. How can you test your website to ensure it is accessible to people with disabilities? Describe how you can overcome potential accessibility issues with your website.

-Testing done on both Chrome and Firefox to ensure cross browser compatibility. Low resolution JPGs were used for image files - although PNG would have been acceptable too. All images have additional descriptions within ALT tags whilst the video has the option of displaying closed captions. As the website uses flexbox for much of its layout coding, it is responsive and easily viewed on larger/smaller screens and at different zoom lengths.

Q6. Describe ways to improve your productivity and efficiency throughout this project (how can you make sure you are using IT tools and systems in the most effective way?) If you could have been more productive or efficient, how would you implement this for a future project?

-I’ll definitely be using Trello and flow charts more to help in the planning stages. In addition, I’d like a better understanding of Visual Studio’s keyboard shortcuts and emmett lists.

Q7. Describe the final version of your website (what is the content and layout for each page?), assess the strengths and weaknesses and describe further improvements you can make to your website. Is the website fit for purpose? (did you achieve what you set out to do in your plan?)

-The website achieves what I set out to do however I would like to make some further adjustments. These could include an awesome contact form , some additional credits and a reworking of the ‘Contact’ page layout.
